					<h1>Hydra</h1>
					
					<p>The hydra is a reptilian horror with a crocodilian body and multiple heads on long, serpentine necks. Although its heads can be severed, the hydra magically regrows them in short order. A typical specimen has five heads.</p>
					<p>At the dawn of time, Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, slew a rival dragon god named Lernaea and cast her blood across the multiverse. Each drop that fell upon a world spawned a multi-headed hydra consumed by a hunger as great as the fallen god’s hatred. Great champions are known to test their mettle against these fearsome creatures.</p>

					<p><b>Everlasting Hunger.</b> A rapacious and gluttonous monster, a hydra snatches and tears apart its prey in a frenzy of feeding. When a hydra has cleared a territory of food and driven off any creatures smart enough to avoid it, it moves on to seek its meals elsewhere. A hydra’s hunger is so great that if it can’t feed, it might turn against itself, its heads attacking each other as the creature eats itself alive.</p>

					<p><b>Hardy Water Dwellers.</b> Hydras are natural swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn’t normally have a lair. Only in colder climes are hydras drawn to the protection of sheltered caverns and ruins.</p>
					<p>When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.</p>
