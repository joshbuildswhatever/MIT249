					<h1>Horned Devil</h1>
					
					<p>Horned devils are lazy to the point of belligerence and reluctant to put themselves in harmâ€™s way. Moreover, they hate and fear any creature stronger than themselves. When they are sufficiently provoked or antagonized, the fury of these fiends can be terrifying.</p>
					<p>A malebranche stands as tall as an ogre and is sheathed in scales as tough as iron. The flying infantry of the hellish legions, horned devils follow orders to the letter. Their huge wings and sweeping horns create an intimidating presence as they drop from the sky and strike with deadly forks and lashing tails.</p>
