					<h1>Flying Sword</h1>
					
					<p>A flying sword dances through the air, fighting with the confidence of a warrior that canâ€™t be injured. Swords are the most common weapons animated with magic. Axes, clubs, daggers, maces, spears, and even self-loading crossbows are also known to exist in animated object form.</p>
					
					<h3>Animated Objects</h3>
					
					<p>Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fullfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automations.</p>
					
					<p><b>Constructed Nature.</b> An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
					<p>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.</p>
